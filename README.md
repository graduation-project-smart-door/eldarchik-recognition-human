<h1>Virtual Depth Camera with Object Detection</h1>
<p>This program uses the Intel RealSense depth camera to capture a stream of color and depth images. It then uses TensorFlow Object Detection API to detect objects in the color image and calculate the distance to the object from the depth image. The detected objects are displayed with bounding boxes and labels on a virtual camera using the pyvirtualcam library.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.6 or higher</li>
  <li>TensorFlow 1.4.0 or higher</li>
  <li>Intel RealSense SDK 2.0</li>
  <li>OpenCV 4.2 or higher</li>
  <li>pyvirtualcam</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Install the Intel RealSense SDK 2.0. Please refer to the official documentation for detailed installation instructions.</p>
<p>Install OpenCV using the following command: <code>pip install opencv-python</code></p>
<p>Install TensorFlow using the following command: <code>pip install tensorflow</code></p>
<p>Install pyvirtualcam using the following command: <code>pip install pyvirtualcam</code></p>
<h2>Running the Program</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone or download the repository to your local machine.</li>
  <li>Connect the Intel RealSense depth camera to your computer.</li>
  <li>Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project.</li>
  <li>Run the following command to start the program: <code>python main.py</code></li>
  <li>The program will start streaming the virtual camera with the detected objects in the color image and the distance to the object in the depth image displayed on the virtual depth camera.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Initialize the pyvirtualcam and Intel RealSense pipeline.</li>
  <li>Wait for frames from the Intel RealSense camera.</li>
  <li>Convert the color and depth images to numpy arrays.</li>
  <li>Calculate the distance to the object from the depth image.</li>
  <li>Expand the color image dimensions to have shape: [1, None, None, 3].</li>
  <li>Feed the color image to the TensorFlow object detection model to detect objects.</li>
  <li>Draw bounding boxes and labels around the detected objects on the color image.</li>
  <li>Display the color and depth images with the detected objects on the virtual camera using pyvirtualcam.</li>
  <li>Repeat steps 2 to 8 until the program is stopped.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Life Cycle</h2>
<p>The program starts by importing the necessary libraries and defining the parameters of the virtual camera, such as the width, height, and position of the detected objects. It then initializes the Intel RealSense pipeline and waits for frames from the depth camera. After converting the color and depth images to numpy arrays, it calculates the distance to the object from the depth image. Next, it expands the color image dimensions to match the input tensor shape of the TensorFlow object detection model and feeds it to the model to detect objects. The detected objects are then displayed with bounding boxes and labels on the color image. Finally, the program uses pyvirtualcam to display the color and depth images with the detected objects on the virtual camera. The program repeats these steps until it is stopped.</p>
